# Supported Models

vllm-metal supports text language models and a small set of native multimodal
models on Apple Silicon. Multimodal support is currently vision-only and runs on
the paged backend.

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Supported model/feature |
| 🔵 | Experimental supported model/feature |
| ❌ | Not supported model/feature |
| 🟡 | Not tested or verified |

Each row tracks a model family. The **Example checkpoint** is one configuration
we have actually run on Metal — a starting point, not the only checkpoint that
works. Other sizes and quantizations of the same family generally work too;
per-machine details (chip, RAM, macOS, reference match) and the full change
history live in the project's PRs, not in this table. If a model or checkpoint
does not work, please open an issue rather than adding more rows or example
checkpoints.

<!-- Keep this a high-level support matrix. Add a feature column only once at
least one shipped model uses it (e.g. speculative decoding, tensor parallel) —
do not add columns for unimplemented features. -->

## Text Pooling

Metal V1 has experimental text-only pooling support. See
[Text Pooling](text_embedding_pooling.md) for scope, usage, and
validation guidance. The reranker requires Qwen3 sequence-classification
`hf_overrides`.

| Model | Support | Runner | Example checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3-Embedding | 🔵 | `pooling` / `embed` (paged) | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-8bit` |
| Qwen3-Reranker | 🔵 | `pooling` / `classify` (paged) | `mku64/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-mlx-8Bit` |
| BGE-M3 | 🔵 | `pooling` / `embed`, `token_classify` (encoder) | `BAAI/bge-m3` |

## Multimodal Language Models

Native multimodal support currently targets image-only vision-language requests on the paged backend.

| Model | Support | Runner | Scope | Example checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3-VL | 🔵 | native multimodal paged generation | image input, no video | `mlx-community/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-4bit` |
| PaddleOCR-VL | 🔵 | native multimodal paged generation | image input, no video | `PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR-VL-1.6` |

## Text-Only Language Models

`Automatic Prefix Cache` is the default behavior when you do not pass
`--enable-prefix-caching`. Since
[#283](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/pull/283), unified paged-KV
models reuse shared prefixes by default. As of vLLM 0.28.0, hybrid/Mamba
models do too; hybrid GDN support remains experimental (`🔵`). These values
describe default engine behavior, not exhaustive per-model benchmarking on
Metal.

HF AWQ checkpoints load through mlx-lm's `_transform_awq_weights` repack, with an
entry-point preflight that normalizes AutoAWQ aliases (`w_bit`, `q_group_size`,
uppercase `"GEMM"`) and rejects unsupported variants (`gemv`, `bits != 4`,
`group_size != 128`, `zero_point=false`) before model state is built. Verified
for Qwen2.5, Llama 3, and Mistral
([#340](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/pull/340),
[#381](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/pull/381)).

GGUF checkpoints serve by detection like AWQ, with no env flag:
vllm-metal's GGUF engine integration sets `quantization=gguf` from the file
(vLLM 0.24 moved its in-tree GGUF support to the CUDA/ROCm-only
[vllm-gguf-plugin](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-gguf-plugin)). A
`.gguf` carries weights only, so it pairs with a companion config dir
(`--tokenizer`) and needs the `gguf` extra; remote `repo_id:quant` references
download one matching unsharded `.gguf` file. The weights stay MLX-native
quantized (Q8_0/Q4_0/Q4_1, not a dense fallback). Scope is dense
`qwen2`/`qwen3`/`llama`/`mistral` (mistral converts under the llama GGUF arch)
with per-tensor `Q8_0`/`Q4_0`/`Q4_1`; K-quants, fused-QKV, MoE, SSM/hybrid,
vision, ambiguous remote matches, and sharded remote GGUF files are rejected
with a clear error. See [GGUF](gguf.md) for serve examples and source
precedence. The narrow exception is an unused tied `output.weight`: MLX may
briefly materialize an unsupported qtype such as Q6_K as FP16 before the loader
discards it. Preflight limits that transient table to 512 MiB. Verified
end-to-end on Qwen3-0.6B Q4_1 and on Qwen3-0.6B,
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 Q8_0
([#415](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/issues/415)).
