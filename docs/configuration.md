# Configuration

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VLLM_METAL_MEMORY_FRACTION` | `auto` | Metal memory budget mode; see [Paged KV vs MLX KV Memory Settings](#paged-kv-vs-mlx-kv-memory-settings) |
| `VLLM_MLX_DEVICE` | `gpu` | MLX device (`gpu` or `cpu`) |
| `VLLM_METAL_USE_PAGED_ATTENTION` | `1` | Enable experimental paged KV cache |
| `VLLM_METAL_DISABLE_NAX` | `0` | Emergency override for automatic M5 NAX prefill attention. Set to `1` to force the non-NAX fallback. |
| `VLLM_METAL_MULTIMODAL_MODE` | `auto` | Multimodal serve mode: `auto` uses the compatibility allowlist; `multimodal-native` disables overrides |
| `VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE` | `False` | Set True to change model registry to <https://www.modelscope.cn/> |
| `VLLM_METAL_MODELSCOPE_CACHE` | None | Specify the absolute path of the local model |
| `VLLM_METAL_GDN_LAZY_KERNELS` | `1` | Enable lazy GDN kernels for eligible hybrid batches. Set to `0` to force the eager conv / C++ recurrent fallback path. |
| `VLLM_METAL_DECODE_PIPELINE` | `1` | One-step-ahead decode sampling pipeline: eligible pure-decode greedy steps defer the sampling sync one step so the next step's graph build and submit overlap the in-flight GPU forward. Greedy output is unchanged. Disabled automatically when speculative decoding is configured. Set to `0` to force the fully synchronous per-step sample path. |
| `VLLM_METAL_COMPILED_MLP` | `0` | Opt-in compiled stateless-MLP dispatch: decode-shaped MLP/MoE block calls run through an `mx.compile` trace, fusing the per-layer elementwise glue and cutting the per-step op count. Outputs are bitwise identical to the eager dispatch for quantized checkpoints (unquantized fp16 fusion may differ at the ulp level). LoRA serves keep the eager path. Off by default while the dispatch gathers serve mileage; set to `1` to enable. |
| `VLLM_METAL_MLA_KERNEL` | `0` | Enable the experimental absorbed-MLA single-pass Metal decode kernel ([RFC #360](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/issues/360)). Off by default; the MLA wrapper falls back to the MLX SDPA per-request slow path. Set to `1` to route absorbed-MLA decode through the kernel when the workload matches the instantiated specialization (`kv_lora_rank=512`, `qk_rope_head_dim=64`, `block_size ∈ {16, 32}`, fp16/bf16, decode-only). |
| `VLLM_METAL_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` | `0` | Compile the native `_paged_ops` Metal extension from source at runtime instead of loading the prebuilt artifact shipped in the wheel. For kernel developers / source installs; requires the Xcode command-line tools (`clang++`). Off by default — release wheels ship the `.so` prebuilt. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md). |
| `VLLM_METAL_SPEC_VERIFY_WINDOW` | `0` | Enable spec-decode verification window mode ([issue #465](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/issues/465)): the K+1 verification rows share each KV block load instead of re-reading the context per row. Off by default; verify windows keep the expanded per-token layout. Outputs are bitwise identical either way; the win is chip- and shape-dependent (measured up to +40% e2e at concurrency 16-32 with 8k contexts on M2/M3 Ultra, and regressions single-stream on M4 Pro and at concurrency 32 on M2 Max). MLA, hybrid-GDN, and head sizes above 256 always use the expanded layout. The same opt-in also merges the `draft_model` proposer's small committed-token ingest into one window per request (head sizes above 256 keep the expanded layout there too); single-stream TPOT is within run-to-run noise of the expanded ingest (0.6B pair, 8k prefix, M4 Pro), and generated tokens are identical. |
| `VLLM_METAL_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | — | Set automatically by the Ray executor per worker (the device-control var); not user-configurable. See [Distributed](distributed.md). |
| `VLLM_METAL_RING_BASE_PORT` | `32323` | Base TCP port for the MLX ring data plane under pipeline parallelism; stage *r* binds `base + r` (so the default is `32323`/`32324` for two stages). Set the **same** value on every node to move the ring off a busy port — e.g. when an `mlx.launch` job, a restart still in `TIME_WAIT`, or another PP job holds the default. See [Distributed](distributed.md#pipeline-parallelism). |

## MLX Command-Buffer Defaults

On macOS the plugin defaults `MLX_MAX_OPS_PER_BUFFER` to `2000` via
`setdefault`, so a value you export yourself always wins. MLX's own default is
sized for small generate loops; a vLLM decode step on a large MoE model builds
thousands of lazy ops per step, and the resulting per-buffer commit overhead
slows the step submit. `2000` sits on the measured plateau.

`MLX_MAX_MB_PER_BUFFER` trades transient profile memory for per-step commit
overhead. The plugin defaults it to `2000` when the usable budget (total
memory times the effective memory fraction) is at least 90 GiB, and leaves it
unset below that, on Ray executors, or when `max_num_batched_tokens` exceeds
4096 (the #585 startup-failure shape). A value you export yourself always
wins. Outputs are unaffected.

## Multimodal Serve Modes

- `auto`: use the text-only compatibility path for checkpoints on the compatibility allowlist, such as Gemma4 and Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 FP8 conditional-generation wrappers.
- `multimodal-native`: disable the compatibility fallback and keep the native multimodal path active when validating or developing real multimodal support.

## Speculative Decoding

Pass `--speculative-config` with a JSON object to enable speculative decoding.
Use `--no-async-scheduling` (required for all spec-decode methods on Metal).
See [Speculative Decoding](speculative_decoding.md) for supported methods,
model pairing, and memory considerations.

## Paged KV vs MLX KV Memory Settings

- MLX path (`VLLM_METAL_USE_PAGED_ATTENTION=0`): `VLLM_METAL_MEMORY_FRACTION` must be `auto`.
- Paged KV path (`VLLM_METAL_USE_PAGED_ATTENTION=1`): `VLLM_METAL_MEMORY_FRACTION` can be `auto` or a numeric fraction in `(0, 1]`.
- For paged KV with `VLLM_METAL_MEMORY_FRACTION=auto`, vllm-metal uses vLLM's `--gpu-memory-utilization` value.

| `VLLM_METAL_MEMORY_FRACTION` | `VLLM_METAL_USE_PAGED_ATTENTION` | Valid? | Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| `auto` | `0` | Yes | MLX path |
| `auto` | `1` | Yes | Paged KV path (default); uses `--gpu-memory-utilization` |
| `0.7` | `1` | Yes | Paged KV path with explicit memory budget |
| `0.7` | `0` | No | Explicit fraction without paged KV is invalid |
