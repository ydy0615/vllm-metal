"""Draft-model speculative decoding proposer for the Metal paged path.

A :class:`DraftModelProposer` drafts with a *separate* full model (vLLM
``method="draft_model"``). Its KV is split into two parts with different
ownership, matching where cross-request cache *reuse* actually happens
(#482):

- The **committed** portion (``[0, committed_len)`` per request) is a real
  scheduler-owned KV-cache group (``cache_policy.ModelCachePolicy.
  _draft_layer_specs``), registered and sized exactly like the target's own
  groups. The scheduler hashes, matches, admits, and evicts it -- so
  ``cache_salt``, per-request cache-read rules (``skip_reading_prefix_cache``),
  and the real admission/allocation limit all apply to it automatically,
  the same way they already apply to the target. This is where content-based
  reuse across requests lives.
- The **speculative lookahead** tail (positions drafted ahead of a request's
  committed length, not yet verified) has no scheduler concept -- no
  registered group is ever "ahead" of a request's committed tokens -- so it
  stays a small, proposer-local scratch reservation
  (``committed_num_blocks + scratch_reserve_blocks``, see
  ``DraftModelProposer.build`` and ``ModelCachePolicy.
  draft_scratch_reserve_blocks``). It never claims cross-request reuse, so
  none of the scheduler-owned group's guarantees are needed there.

**Block-alignment note.** When ``committed_len`` is not a multiple of
``block_size``, the last committed block is only partially filled with
scheduler-owned KV.  The lookahead draft steps write their speculative KV
into the remaining slots of that same scheduler-owned block (and into scratch
blocks beyond it, if needed).  This is safe because ingest rewrites every
position in ``[draft_seq_len, committed_len)`` *before* the block can be
hashed: the scheduler only content-hashes a block once it is fully filled,
and by that point a future ingest step will have overwritten the speculative
slots with the correct committed KV.  No stale draft KV can leak into a
prefix-cache match.

**Why every active row ingests, not just drafting-eligible ones.** The
scheduler advances a request's ``num_computed_tokens`` and marks the
committed group's blocks "cached" based on its own per-step bookkeeping,
trusting that whatever it scheduled, the worker actually computed -- for
*every* registered group, uniformly, every step. But
``SpeculativeDecodeController.draft_eligible_requests`` intentionally
excludes non-greedy requests and intermediate prefill chunks from
*drafting*. If those rows also skipped *ingest*, the scheduler would believe
their committed-group blocks hold real KV when they never did, and a later,
unrelated request whose prompt happens to hash-match that prefix could be
handed those blocks as a "cache hit" -- silent data corruption, not just a
missed optimization. So ``propose()`` ingests every decode and prefill row
(chunked or not, greedy or not) to keep the committed group's physical KV
genuinely in sync with what the scheduler believes, and only *drafts*
(produces returned token ids, runs the extra lookahead decode steps) for the
eligible subset.

Each step: ingest advances every row's committed KV to ``committed_len``,
then ``num_speculative_tokens - 1`` single-token decode steps run for
drafting rows only. Drafts are handed back via ``take_draft_token_ids`` and
verified next step by ``SpeculativeDecodeController.verify_greedy``.

**Skipping already-valid speculative KV (#482, direction 2).** The
lookahead draft steps write KV for drafts ``d1..d(K-1)`` at positions
``[committed_len, committed_len + K - 1)``. When the next round's committed
tokens match those drafts (greedy acceptance is a prefix, so accepted drafts
keep their identities), that KV is exactly what the ingest would recompute
-- so the ingest skips it (``_speculative_kv_valid_through``), shrinking the
steady-state K+1-token ingest to 2 rows on full acceptance. A position is
skipped only when its committed token equals the recorded drafted token AND
the scheduler's committed-group block table still maps the position to the
same physical block the speculative write landed in (speculative KV that
crossed into a scratch block is never reused -- the scheduler allocates its
own block there). The last committed token is always re-ingested: its
logits are needed to predict this round's first draft token anyway.
