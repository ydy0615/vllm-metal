        if no cluster is reachable — DP requires a running Ray cluster.

        #   validation.
        # - The Metal kernel uses a translated block_size (16, the kernel sweet
        #   spot) that it supports.
        # - Each vLLM block is split into ratio = cache_block_size / kernel_block_size
        #   kernel blocks. For example, one vLLM block of 144 tokens becomes 9 kernel
        #   blocks of 16 tokens each.

        #   [num_blocks*9, 16, ...]. The physical memory layout is unchanged.
        # - Block tables are expanded so the kernel reads the correct blocks.
